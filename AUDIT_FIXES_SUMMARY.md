- Implemented data validation function with checks for:
  - Empty data
  - Null values in target and features
  - Infinite values
  - Feature count consistency
- Added try-catch blocks for all major operations
- Enhanced MLflow metric logging (MSE, RMSE, MAE)
- Added detailed error messages and debugging information
- Improved model performance reporting

#### **File:** `data-science/src/register.py`
**Improvements:**
- Added comprehensive logging with structured format
- Implemented model path validation
- Added checks for required MLflow model files
- Added try-catch blocks for all major operations

- Better workflow orchestration

## 6. Testing Recommendations

### **Unit Testing:**
- **Location:** `data-science/tests/`
- **Purpose:** Test individual functions in prep.py, train.py, and register.py
- **Why:** Ensure data preprocessing, model training, and model registration work correctly

### **Integration Testing:**
- **Location:** `mlops/tests/`
- **Purpose:** Test the complete pipeline end-to-end
- **Why:** Verify that all components work together correctly

### **Data Validation Testing:**
- **Location:** `data-science/tests/test_data_validation.py`
- **Purpose:** Test data quality checks and schema validation
- **Why:** Prevent pipeline failures due to data quality issues

## 7. Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Test the Pipeline:** Run the improved pipeline to verify all fixes work correctly
2. **Monitor Logs:** Use the enhanced logging to identify any remaining issues
3. **Review Metrics:** Check MLflow metrics for model performance insights

### **Future Improvements:**
1. **Add Unit Tests:** Implement comprehensive test coverage
2. **Implement Monitoring:** Add Azure Monitor integration for better observability
3. **Add Alerting:** Set up notifications for pipeline failures
4. **Performance Optimization:** Monitor and optimize compute resource usage

## 8. Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/deploy-model-training-pipeline-classical.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/custom-run-pipeline.yml`
3. `mlops/azureml/train/newpipeline.yml`
4. `data-science/src/prep.py`
5. `data-science/src/train.py`
6. `data-science/src/register.py`
7. `create-azure-sp.sh`

## 9. Expected Outcomes

With these improvements, the pipeline should now:
